## Dear Future Me,

I’m writing to you at 33, during a season of profound change and reflection. Life feels especially fragile right now, stitched together from moments of both light and shadow. Just days ago, I lost my mother - a reality that still seems impossible to accept. I find myself replaying memories, wishing I had called more, visited more, or simply made more time. I hope you remember her bright, cheerful spirit and her deep love for life. She could be anxious and a little nervous at times, but her warmth and joy were infectious. She loved you with all her heart - her devotion was the truest thing in your world. Though her journey was often lonely and filled with challenges, she faced it all with resilience and an unwavering love for you.

I’m still in Russia, working as a marketing lead in IT. Some days bring a sense of accomplishment, but often I’m left wanting something deeper and more creative. I dream of building something meaningful, of finding work that feels like a true expression of myself. The daily routine - campaigns, meetings, endless busyness - can feel like running in circles.

This year, an unexpected opportunity for a new beginning presented itself, one that could open doors to a different life abroad. The process is slow and uncertain, and I don’t know if it will work out. It’s difficult to hold onto hope when the outcome is so unclear, but I try to stay focused, to prepare, and to be patient with the unknown.

A couple of months ago, a car accident left my car wrecked and, for a while, left me feeling shaken. At the time, it felt like a big deal, but now, in the shadow of losing my mother, it barely matters. Her loss has put everything else in perspective. Through all of this, my wife has been my anchor. I love her deeply, and I’m grateful every day for her support and understanding. I hope our love only grows stronger as we move forward together.

I’m making an effort to take better care of myself - going to the gym, eating healthier, seeing doctors more regularly. But old habits are hard to break: staying up too late, slipping back into routines that aren’t good for me. My father passed away years ago, but our relationship faded long before that. I wonder how those losses have shaped me, and if I’ll ever fully understand.

I’m grateful for the family I have left - my wife, my relatives. I’m especially thankful to my mother for everything she gave me: her love, her guidance, her sacrifices. I try to remember the comfort and support that surrounds me, and to appreciate the opportunities I’ve had.

Looking ahead, I hope you’ve found the courage to pursue your dreams: to build something of your own, to create at the intersection of technology and art. I hope your life feels meaningful, not just busy. I hope you have a home filled with laughter, love, and maybe children of your own.

You’ve faced difficult challenges: the loss of your mother, the uncertainty of new beginnings, the instability of the world, and the fading of old dreams. But you’ve kept going-working, saving, and trying to stay healthy in body and mind.

If I could offer you advice, it would be this: don’t let fear or routine keep you from what matters most. Remember how fragile life is. Stay grateful-for the people you love, for the memories you carry, for the chances you’ve been given. Take care of your health, and never lose your curiosity or your drive to create.

I wonder if you’ve managed to step away from the corporate world and build something of your own. Are you fulfilled? Are you healthy? I hope so. I hope you look back on these years with gratitude, even for the hardships, and feel proud of how far you’ve come.

When you read this, I hope you smile - maybe with a touch of sadness for what’s been lost, but mostly with pride and joy for what you’ve built. Remember the last journey home for your mother’s farewell: the laughter with family, the stories, the time at the dacha, the walks through the village. These moments of connection and remembrance are what make life beautiful.

Take care of yourself, and never stop moving forward.

With hope and gratitude,  
Your 33-year-old self
