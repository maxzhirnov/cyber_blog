Dear Future Me,

I’m writing to you at 33, during a season of profound change and reflection. Life feels especially fragile right now, stitched together from moments of both light and shadow. Just days ago, I lost my mother - a reality that still seems impossible to accept. I find myself replaying memories, wishing I had called more, visited more, or simply made more time. I hope you remember her bright, cheerful spirit and her deep love for life. She could be anxious and a little nervous at times, but her warmth and joy were infectious. She loved you with all her heart - her devotion was the truest thing in your world. Though her journey was often lonely and filled with challenges, she faced it all with resilience and an unwavering love for you.

I’m still in Russia, working as a marketing lead in IT. Some days bring a sense of accomplishment, but often I’m left wanting something deeper and more creative. I dream of building something meaningful, of finding work that feels like a true expression of myself. The daily routine - campaigns, meetings, endless busyness - can feel like running in circles.

This year, an unexpected opportunity for a new beginning presented itself, one that could open doors to a different life abroad. The process is slow and uncertain, and I don’t know if it will work out. It’s difficult to hold onto hope when the outcome is so unclear, but I try to stay focused, to prepare, and to be patient with the unknown.

A couple of months ago, a car accident left my car wrecked and, for a while, left me feeling shaken. At the time, it felt like a big deal, but now, after losing my mother, it barely matters. My aunt always says, these are just “the little things in life” (мелочи жизни), and she’s right - my mother’s passing has put everything else in perspective. Through all of this, my wife has been my anchor. I love her deeply, and I’m grateful every day for her support and understanding. I hope our love only grows stronger as we move forward together.

I’m making an effort to take better care of myself - going to the gym, eating healthier, seeing doctors more regularly. But old habits die hard: staying up too late, slipping back into routines that aren’t good for me. Sometimes I wonder if these patterns are rooted in my past, or shaped by the relationships I’ve lost. My father passed away years ago, but our relationship faded long before that. I wonder how those losses have shaped me, and if I’ll ever fully understand.

I know my childhood wasn’t always easy, and there were times when life was especially hard for our family. Despite everything, my mother gave all she could - working tirelessly as a single parent to provide me with opportunities, an education, and a better start in life. Her love was boundless, and I was always at the center of her world. Even though she’s gone, her presence and the lessons I learned from her - both in what she did and what she struggled with - remain a part of me. I’m also grateful for the family I have now - my wife and my relatives - whose support and love give me strength every day.

Looking ahead, I hope you’ve found the courage to follow your dreams and to live a life that feels true to who you are. I hope your days feel meaningful, not just busy, and that your home is filled with laughter, love, and maybe children of your own.

You’ve faced difficult challenges: the loss of your mother, the uncertainty of new beginnings, the instability of the world, and the sense that the world itself has changed in ways that have narrowed possibilities. First there was the pandemic, then the war. Life has become more limited - opportunities for interesting work, for moving abroad, or even just for traveling have all felt more out of reach. The country has changed, and sometimes it feels like things were better, both here and in the world, not so long ago. But you’ve kept going - working, saving, and trying to stay healthy in body and mind.

Looking back, I hope you remember that it doesn’t matter whether you managed to move abroad or build your own business. If you are happy, and if you are surrounded by love, that is what matters most. Success isn’t just about plans fulfilled or goals achieved, but about finding meaning, connection, and joy in the life you have.

If I could offer you advice, it would be this: don’t let fear or routine keep you from what matters most. Remember how fragile life is. Stay grateful - for the people you love, for the memories you carry, for the chances you’ve been given. Take care of your health, and never lose your curiosity or your drive to create.

However your path unfolded, I hope you stayed true to yourself and found meaning along the way. I hope you feel fulfilled and healthy, and that you look back on these years with gratitude, even for the hardships, and with pride for how far you’ve come.

When you read this, I hope you smile - maybe with a touch of sadness for what’s been lost, but mostly with pride and joy for what you’ve built. Remember the last journey home for your mother’s farewell: the laughter with family, the stories, the time at the dacha, the walks through the village. These moments of connection and remembrance are what make life beautiful.

Take care of yourself, and never stop moving forward.

With hope and gratitude,  
Your 33-year-old self
