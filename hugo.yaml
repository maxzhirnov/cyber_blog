      Hey, I’m <span class='text-fuchsia-400 font-bold'>Maksim Zhirnov</span> — growth marketing strategist, automation expert, and unapologetic vibe coder.
      <br>
      <br>
      By day, I architect data-driven growth strategies and automate workflows that let brands scale at light speed. My toolkit is packed with sharp analytics, custom scripts, and an eye for the kind of solutions that turn digital static into measurable signals.
      <br>
      <br>
      Coding for me isn’t just a job — it’s where logic meets imagination. Whether I’m building backend automations, designing unique customer journeys, or creating modular systems that hum beneath the surface, I’m always searching for that perfect intersection of efficiency and creative spark.
      <br>
      <br>
      When the screens dim, I dial up the synthwave, chase down new flavors across the city, and hit the gym with the kind of energy I bring to every project. I believe the best ideas happen at the crossroads of technical curiosity and a hunger for experience—digital, culinary, and everything in-between.
      <br>
